# General

Every new feature (as well as bugfixes) should come through a [github pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and should have test cases for it.

Go [here](https://github.com/CartoDB/odbc_fdw/tree/master/test#connectors-integration-tests) to learn how the test framework works and how to add new tests to the project.

# Bugs and features

Before you start working on a new feature, we encourage you to create an issue in github explaining what are you going to do in order to help you and especially to avoid duplicate work.

There are several rules you should follow when a new pull request is created:

- Title has to be descriptive. If you are fixing a bug don't just use the ticket title or number.
- Explain what you have achieved in the description.
- All tests [should pass](https://github.com/CartoDB/odbc_fdw/tree/master/test#how-to-execute-the-tests).

# Submitting contributions

Before opening a pull request (or submitting a contribution) you will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before making a submission, [learn more here](https://carto.com/contributions).
